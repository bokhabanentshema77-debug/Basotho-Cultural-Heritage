<h1>The brief discription of Basotho music and dances</h1>

<p>The Basotho people normally do their traditional dances and music on their special occasions.<br>The dances are normally done when there are special occasions like when people are getting married there will be some rejoicing after that as a dance.<br>But with music it is way too different because Basotho men can just sing the <i>mokorotlo</i> song when they are chilling at <i>Khotla ea banna</i> for no reason.<br>Some of their songs are just for encourage them to have peace.<br></p>
